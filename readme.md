This is my version of the facial classification system for the ADA assignment part 3.

To run this, you will need to have node.js on your system and a free port to run a local server on.

By default, port 8000 is used to communicate to the server. This can be changed by the port variable found on the top of the model.js and server.js file respectively.

I don't imagine there will be any issues using node.js on other OS but this has been made to work for my system, which is a Windows.

I have also included the test data that I used during my testing but do not expect the same results that I had for my pdf submission. These models are already trained and will not learn from any more data being handed to it.

This code is not well written (can be refactored and improved logically). I am sharing the link for my code simply for evidence submission of my own work. Thank you :)
